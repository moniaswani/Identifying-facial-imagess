This disease, caused by mutations in multiple exons of ENPP1, frequently results in death in infancy. Nowadays, the most promising therapeutic compounds for this rare disease are bisphosphonates. We describe a case of GACI associated with the novel mutation c.653A>T (p.D218V) in ENPP1 on both alleles. The male infant was delivered prematurely and developed heart failure, severe hypertension, and diffuse calcifications of all arterial districts. He was treated with etidronate (18 mg/kg/day); however, the clinical condition did not improve, and a resolution of calcifications was not observed. The infant died within the 6th month of life of ischemic heart failure. We conclude that even if the diagnosis of GACI is established early and bisphosphonate treatment is started early, the prognosis can be very poor.",2011-05-28,1

Mutations in tubulin genes can have a severe impact on microtubule function and result in heterogeneous clinical presentations. Current understanding of the clinical spectrum of tubulinopathies is predominantly based on research in fetal tissue and early-childhood cases. METHODS: Testing of candidate genes followed by whole-exome sequencing was performed in an adult woman with a neurodevelopmental, hyperkinetic movement disorder, to identify the underlying genetic cause. Bioinformatic modeling and a systematic review of literature was conducted to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations. RESULTS: The patient was found to carry a heterozygous, de novo c.722G>A, p.R241H mutation in a conserved domain of TUBB2B, encoding the beta-isoform of tubulin. In silico analysis indicated that this mutation was pathogenic. On neuroimaging, the patient had asymmetric pachygyria and dysmorphic basal ganglia. Her neurological examination demonstrated mild cognitive impairment, myoclonus-dystonia, and skeletal anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report the unique phenotype of an adult TUBB2B mutation carrier. This case illustrates a relatively mild phenotype compared to previously described fetal and early childhood cases. This highlights the importance of obtaining molecular genetic testing in individuals with a high probability of a genetic disease, including undiagnosed adult patients.",2017-05-08,1

We included 22 patients (21 female and 1 male) and returned information on diagnosis, indications for prophylactic infusions, frequency and dose, analgesia, activity and employment and complications including thromboembolic disease and iron overload.The median age at presentation with porphyria was 21 years (range 9-44), with acute abdominal pain as the predominant symptom. Patients had a median of 12 (1-400) attacks before starting prophylaxis and had received a median of 52 (0-1,350) doses of haem arginate. The median age at starting prophylaxis was 28 years (13-58) with a median delay of 4 years (0.5-37) between presentation and prophylaxis. The frequency of prophylactic haem arginate varied from 1 to 8 per month, and 67% patients were documented as having a reduction in pain frequency on prophylaxis. Only one patient developed clinically significant iron overload and required iron chelation, but the number of venous access devices required varied from 1 to 15, with each device lasting a median of 1.2 years before requiring replacement. Six patients stopped haem arginate and in three this was because their symptoms had improved. Prophylactic haem arginate appears to be beneficial in patients with recurrent acute porphyria symptoms, but maintaining central venous access may prove challenging.",2015-05-28,1

We combined genome-wide linkage analysis with exome sequencing and identified 14 different mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (encoded by CSF1R) in 14 families with HDLS. In one kindred, we confirmed the de novo occurrence of the mutation. Follow-up sequencing identified an additional CSF1R mutation in an individual diagnosed with corticobasal syndrome. In vitro, CSF-1 stimulation resulted in rapid autophosphorylation of selected tyrosine residues in the kinase domain of wild-type but not mutant CSF1R, suggesting that HDLS may result from partial loss of CSF1R function. As CSF1R is a crucial mediator of microglial proliferation and differentiation in the brain, our findings suggest an important role for microglial dysfunction in HDLS pathogenesis.",2011-12-25,1

Approximately 20% of patients with XP also develop progressive neurologic degeneration. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a boy who was found to have XP after a severe burn following minimal sun exposure. His maternal uncle, now age 20 years, had been diagnosed with XP after a similar sunburn in infancy. The uncle has the typical skin pigmentary findings of XP along with severe progressive neurologic involvement. Although the infant's parents were not known to be blood relatives, the infant and his affected uncle proved to be compound heterozygotes for the same 2 frameshift mutations in the XPA DNA repair gene (c.288delT and c.349_353del). After the diagnosis of XP in the infant, genealogic investigation identified a common Dutch ancestor for both of his grandfathers 5 generations back. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling families at risk for a rare inherited disease is not always straightforward. The sociocultural and demographic backgrounds of the families must be considered for evaluation of risk assessment.",2009-11-28,1

Their occurrence across different cancers has, however, not been investigated. Using the cBioPortal database we show that human actins are infrequently mutated in patient samples of various cancers types. Nevertheless, ranking these studies by mutational frequency suggest that some have a higher percentage of patients with ACTB and ACTG1 mutations. Within studies on hematological cancers, mutations in ACTB and ACTG1 are associated with lymphoid cancers since none have currently been reported in myeloid cancers. Within the different types of lymphoid cancers ACTB mutations are most frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and ACTG1 mutations in multiple myeloma. We mapped the ACTB and ACTG1 mutations found in these two cancer types on the 3D-structure of actin showing they are in regions important for actin polymer formation or binding to myosin. The potential effects of the mutations on actin properties imply that mutations in cytoplasmic actins deserve dedicated research in DLBCL and multiple myeloma.",2020-04-27,1

Other conditions soon followed, with the list of human disorders caused by FGFR3 mutations now reaching at least 10. An array of vastly different diagnoses is caused by similar mutations in FGFR3, including syndromes affecting skeletal development (hypochondroplasia [HCH], ACH, thanatophoric dysplasia [TD]), skin (epidermal nevi, seborrhaeic keratosis, acanthosis nigricans), and cancer (multiple myeloma [MM], prostate and bladder carcinoma, seminoma). Despite many years of research, several aspects of FGFR3 function in disease remain obscure or controversial. As FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasias are caused by growth attenuation of the cartilage, chondrocytes appear to be unique in their response to FGFR3 activation. However, the reasons why FGFR3 inhibits chondrocyte growth while causing excessive cellular proliferation in cancer are not clear. Likewise, the full spectrum of molecular events by which FGFR3 mediates its signaling is just beginning to emerge. This article describes the challenging journey to unravel the mechanisms of FGFR3 function in skeletal dysplasias, the extraordinary cellular manifestations of FGFR3 signaling in chondrocytes, and finally, the progress toward therapy for ACH and cancer.",2012-01-28,1
